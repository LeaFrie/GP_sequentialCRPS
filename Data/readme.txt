In this folder, we have the Photoswitch dataset:

@article{Thawani_2020,
      title={The Photoswitch Dataset: A Molecular Machine Learning Benchmark for the Advancement of Synthetic Chemistry}, 
      author={Aditya R. Thawani and Ryan-Rhys Griffiths and Arian Jamasb and Anthony Bourached and Penelope Jones and William McCorkindale and Alexander A. Aldrick and Alpha A. Lee},
      year={2020},
      eprint={2008.03226},
      archivePrefix={arXiv},
      primaryClass={physics.chem-ph}
}

It was collected from: https://github.com/Ryan-Rhys/The-Photoswitch-Dataset/tree/master/dataset
and contains a collection of 392 photoswitch molecules and their experimental E isomer π = π∗ transition wavelengths.

Furthermore, we generate a synthetic version of the dataset with available ground truth.
