In this folder, we have the Photoswitch dataset:

Thawani, A. R., Griffiths, R.-R., Jamasb, A., Bourached, A., Jones, P., McCorkindale,
W., Aldrick, A. A., and Lee, A. A. (2020). The Photoswitch Dataset: A molecular
machine learning benchmark for the advancement of synthetic chemistry. ChemRxiv,
doi:10.26434/chemrxiv.12609899.v1. This content is a preprint and has not been peer-reviewed.

It was collected from: https://github.com/Ryan-Rhys/The-Photoswitch-Dataset/tree/master/dataset
and contains a collection of 392 photoswitch molecules and their experimental E isomer π = π∗ transition wavelengths.

Furthermore, we generate a synthetic version of the dataset with available ground truth.
